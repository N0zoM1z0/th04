# TH04 current handoff

The user is actively using the Windows host. Do not launch Windows GUI
tests, activate foreground windows or inject host keys. Keep every launch
muted; use headless checks or private Linux Xvfb instead. Actual Windows
window/input acceptance stays open under this constraint.

Both final CIs pass, including root live Ghidra replay/mutations. Current
host-window/recovery receipts retain distinct producer/consumer identities.
All launches remain muted.

Updated 2026-10-10. Current focus: resumed x64 implementation on its separate
branch; DOS demo state is retained. This handoff
indexes verified state; detailed experiments belong in focused notes and CSV
ledgers. General semantic work has reached its stopping condition: resume it
only for an ambiguity that blocks a concrete native port owner.

## Products and claim boundaries

| Product | State | Authority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Historical reconstruction | OP 93/93, MAIN 493/495, MAINE 72/72, ZUN 3/3 accepted authored functions | [Generated progress](PROGRESS.md), acceptance ledgers |
| Standalone DOS PC-98 game | Four products build from maintained local source without master.lib or ReC98 product includes; repaired normal and invincible variants | [DOS operation](DOS_BUILD.md), [hardware findings](PC98_HARDWARE_REUSE.md) |
| Semantic DOS source | Asset, memory, input/timing, scroll, bullet/VM/shot/item, RNG, score and process contracts clarified | [Semantic summary](SEMANTIC_READABILITY.md) |
| Linux/Windows x64 | Separate `port/modern-64` branch; component-tested normal stages and cutscenes; complete game still unfinished | [Port status and TODO](PORTING_STATUS.md) |

Function acceptance is not whole-file exactness. OP/MAINE/ZUN counts cover
recovered payload functions, not original packed-file extents. MAIN's carpet
and checkerboard cases remain deferred; no acceptance is promoted by the
native fixes or this documentation cleanup. Targets remain
`candidate-local-attested` (a provenance gap).

## DOS verification frontier

- The user reports complete Normal routes/Endings/save and earlier invincible
  Easy/Lunatic runs. These are manual Windows observations.
- Recorded ordinary controls cover startup, OP options/Music Room/config
  persistence, Orange clear, Stage 2 entry, the repaired Kurumi empty-ring
  failure and Stage 3 entry. Seeded Good Endings reach registration and save
  the expected section; their final black frames do not accept fresh OP.
- Upper-left pellet corruption is confirmed and repaired by full EAX clearing;
  seven ordinary checkpoints exclude the old mark. The Stage 6 stripe's
  connection to initial scroll state remains inferred, with user confirmation
  that the stripe disappeared.
- Scalar/CPU/I-O controls reject planar and bullet drawing regressions. A
  440-bullet Lunatic/Turbo fixture measures improvement, including the extreme
  all-cloud phase. It is not a natural full Lunatic route or Windows FPS test.
- Full natural dense Lunatic timing/audio, the optional Windows 36,000-cycle
  profile and a second PC-98 emulator remain validation TODOs. New DOS
  performance work is outside the current native batch.

See [reusable hardware contracts and limits](PC98_HARDWARE_REUSE.md) for each
repair, replay entrypoint and evidence/knowledge routing.

## Native x64 frontier

v1357 closes actual GNU/optimized-UBSan Normal Reimu A window routes on
unchanged v1356 programs. Ordinary OS keys traverse all six stages without
Continue, then Ending, registration Esc, physical score rename, fresh OP and
separate Scores restart. Complete traces contain 89,008/86,333 route and
794/795 restart refreshes, zero audio opens/failures, earned Normal admission,
unchanged CFG and nine other decoded score partitions. This accepts native
instrumented private-Xvfb routes only, not original whole-route equivalence,
physical Windows input, all rank/shot combinations or dense Lunatic performance.

The schedule reducer verifies every deadline against preceding after-update
slowdown or recorded resync, plus v1/v2/v3 widths and terminal counts. Native
MAIN includes 3,245/2,765 slowdown2 records; GNU/UBSan observe 2/505 resyncs.
Instrumented CPU/presentation/advice/trace cost remains separate from acceptance
of uninstrumented performance. Five consumer mutants reject wrong deadlines,
wrong row versions, missing termination/stage and checksum-valid lost admission.

Extra v1 reaches actual Game Over at MAIN frame 25,595; keep its failed verdict.
Persistent private-Xvfb XTest keys pass independent server keymap/release and
request-cost checks; the new Extra trial is pending until physical full-name,
clear-file and separate restart checks close. Do not infer the failure's cause
from the controller benchmark. Current receipts: native
`.analysis/port64/window-route-v1357/`; GNU Normal is retained under
`.analysis/port64/full-window-v1356/linux-normal-adaptive-v5/`.

All 27 muted driver/BGM/SE startup combinations pass on GNU/UBSan (32,147
refreshes) on v1355 programs. Windows retains 19 cases only. No Windows GUI,
foreground or host-key retries while the user uses the host. Earlier wrong-map
and corrected fixed/path Game Over failures remain failed. Live advice is const
output; OS input still owns the keys. No game/clock/score/life injection.
Specific owned private-Xvfb jobs are recorded in v1357
`active-window-jobs-v1.json`; re-poll before deciding completion or restart.

Cold v1356 products retain 485 inputs (`00af24f7…`) and 204 program
identities. GNU/UBSan pass 67 contracts each plus manual held-input
regressions with advice disabled. Windows is cross-compiled only; its
new execution remains unverified. 104/105 GNU/MinGW core objects equal
v1355; only trace serialization changes. Both control-plane CIs pass
(root includes live Ghidra replay/mutations). Historical acceptance
and target provenance are unchanged.

The extracted policy preserves the complete 88,934-tick logical Normal
Reimu A input/state/startup/menu/Ending streams and physical saves.
The v1357 route checks above are independent; no uninstrumented timing follows.

v1355 adds a read-only trace v2 score/life/statistics snapshot and an ordinary
X11 Continue/save/restart verifier. 204 AMD64 programs build cold from 481
producer inputs; GNU8, optimized UBSan and actual Windows pass 67 contracts each.
Among 105 GNU/MinGW core objects, only trace serialization changes; 104 remain
raw-equal to v1354. GNU/UBSan's 195 fake-audio frontend files per host also equal
v1354. No audio backend/device opens.

Eight real SDL/X11 processes under private Xvfb pass two stationary Lunatic
Reimu A Continue/Quit/registration/fresh OP cases and two physical-file Scores
restarts per GNU8/UBSan. MAIN freezes at frames 432/630 during Game Over and
resumes at 433; Continue resets score/power/lives/credit. Missing-score/unranked
and declared zero-score/ranked leaderboard fixtures are distinct. Ranked
writer-close/rename snapshots contain CONTINUE 500 units with credit 0 while
MAIN resets to credit 1/score 0. Nine other decoded partitions preserve checksum
and payload; encoding keys legitimately change. Restarts preserve file hashes.
All launches are muted. These are bounded OS-input trials, not complete clear
routes, original whole-route equivalence, physical devices or dense timing.

Producer manifest: `cce4f0fd683c5166f798303e2ebfb83a4fbbe8baef1ee56a862c024c25dbe3be`.
Final verifier: `d027a9701ce8c6168c408bd18a93b72806e60079e87cbf39b7ab8d0ef9267f5c`.
Only the route verifier differs; every compiled input is raw-identical.
Keep the first missing-verdict-key and key-header comparator failures failed.
Current evidence/recovery: native `.analysis/port64/host-route-v1355/`;
replay/limits: native `docs/port64/evidence/host-window.md`.

Actual Windows still rejects before SendInput. PID/class selection now excludes
an early ConsoleWindowClass handle. Same-session WinSta0/Default diagnostics
observe foreground-lock timeout 2147483647 ms; three owned-window activation
attempts fail. No desktop/global policy/input-queue workaround was used.
Passing Windows contracts do not accept Windows held input.

Remaining: actual Windows input/startup, other ranks/shots/Endings/Continue,
complete Extra windows, physical refresh/slowdown2 and dense Lunatic performance.
Physical audio remains untested under the user's mute instruction. Existing
v1354 experimental package/user DOS images and saves remain untouched.

v1355 scoped cleanup keeps all 204 programs, producer/consumer source archives,
compiler/CMake metadata, traces, physical files, captures and failed attempts.
It retires 1190 regenerable build files / 70 completed contract-stage files after
two full recovery archives / 144 members read back, net 596836352 allocated bytes.
An independent replay verifies 2847 protected hashes and all 1260 absent files.
The three earlier desktop stages retire 20 files, net 35110912 bytes; the terminal
GUI stage and archived failed consumer materialization retire 494 files,
net 22450176 bytes. Immutable capture sharing keeps 324 complete BMP/PCM paths
and hashes, net 210509824 bytes. Counts subtract their journals/archives but
exclude final receipt size. No original input, accepted program or save deleted.
Post-CI pruning retires 1020 source-backed Python caches, net 16822272 allocated
bytes; root `.analysis/cleanup/host-route-post-ci-caches-v1355.json` records
source/hash readback. Both CIs pass, including root live Ghidra replay/mutations.

## Windows DOS demo package

The demo directory retains `start-th04-normal.bat` (ordinary damage) and
`start-th04.bat` (separately compiled invincible MAIN), plus their two unchanged
images/products, standard 24,000-cycle profiles, emulator/font and English
source builder. Independent saves are preserved by full-image hash readback.
Native previews and optional launchers are archived outside that directory.
Windows `Build-TH04.ps1 -CheckOnly -Normal` passes; no rebuild or game launch
was performed. See [retention](ANALYSIS_RETENTION.md) for recovery.
