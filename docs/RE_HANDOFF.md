# TH04 native branch handoff

The user is actively using the Windows host. Do not launch Windows GUI
tests, activate foreground windows or inject host keys. Keep every launch
muted; use headless checks or private Linux Xvfb instead. Actual Windows
window/input acceptance stays open under this constraint.

Updated 2026-10-10. Current phase: handoff; original/reconstructed DOS comparison
is the next validation priority, with x64 fidelity tracked separately. The full
native goal stays active; historical exactness remains separate. Resume semantic
changes for a reproduced differential or a concrete portable owner.

Both handoff CIs pass (root includes live Ghidra replay/mutations). No new game
or compiler build is started for cleanup. Root/native public-source Python
caches retire1,019 files/net16,543,744 allocated B with two full readbacks;
516 protected hashes stay unchanged. Recovery/journal is under root
`.analysis/cleanup/handoff-source-caches*-v1364.json`. Obtain current commit
identities with `git log -1` in each worktree.

## Native x64 frontier

The v1362 GNU Reimu A / Lunatic / Turbo0 candidate is now terminal and
accepted by the independent `verify_natural_slowdown.py` reader: 88,249 route
refreshes plus 792 refreshes in a separate Scores process. It reaches all six
stages without Continue, exits registration by Esc, returns to fresh OP, and
stores real section3 clear mask1 at the physical rename and final file. The nine
other decoded score partitions and CFG stay unchanged; no pending file remains.
Final MAIN: stage5/frame13,649, lives7, misses6, score units5,597,294.

Natural density reaches439 bullets. At >=320 there are571 refreshes/287
slowdown2; at >=400 there are240/129. Complete deadlines/terminal counts pass.
At >=400, update P95/P99/max are6.61/8.50/13.37ms with no update exceeding its
own admission period. This is instrumented GNU/private-Xvfb/shared-WSL evidence;
uninstrumented physical FPS and original DOS parity remain unaccepted. Generic
traces do not expose every inner Ending phase. Audio opens remain zero.

Two actual ordinary X early-hit cancellations occur in Stage4, preserving miss
count while consuming stock, starting Bomb, clearing respawn and setting
invincibility255. The last-life proactive policy branch remains dry-controlled
only. Separate ordinary window probes pass early/closed cases (1,039/1,048
refreshes): early X cancels frame394 hit at395; closed-window X at401 remains
rejected at404 (stock2, Bomb inactive, miss1, respawn61). The first late probe
stays failed: its cleanup incorrectly expected MAIN Esc to return to OP, while
the host Escape handler exits MAIN directly. This is a probe cleanup failure,
not a demonstrated Bomb failure or original Escape-parity acceptance.

Retained GNU Reimu A routes:

| Route | Route + independent Scores refreshes | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Normal/Turbo1 | 89,008 +794 | Six stages/noContinue, physical clear/freshOP/restart |
| Lunatic/Turbo1 | 88,927 +790 | Physical clear; dense slowdown2 absent |
| Lunatic/Turbo0 | 88,249 +792 | Physical clear plus natural dense slowdown2 gates |
| Extra | 30,388 +790 | NoContinue, full eight A gaiji, physical clear/restart |

Prior UBSan Normal all-clear acceptance is revoked: mask0x19 is an unplayed
sentinel even though bit0 is set. The v1360 GNU Turbo0 attempt also stays failed
(88,267 refreshes, Final Stage miss13, masks0x19); its separate795-refresh
Scores reader and bounded dense slowdown observations remain valid. Require
mask<4 plus the selected shot bit, never bit0 alone. All these jobs are terminal;
do not poll or revive dated PID/tool handles from historical active-job files.

Registration, lifecycle/Continue/HUD, stage/Ending/Extra, score/config, demo,
MusicRoom/unlocks and muted sound owners have separate component/integration
evidence. Eight actual GNU/UBSan Continue cases and ten GNU setup/corrupt-file
cases are retained. Startup combinations cover27 GNU/UBSan and19 earlier
Windows cases. Broader character/shot/rank/Ending/Extra routes, actual Windows
display/input, physical audio and uninstrumented performance remain open.

No C++ rebuild: compiled producer485 inputs/`00af24f7…`, GNU game
`dbe17225…`, UBSan `029e7ba1…`, Windows `5b6cf2c3…` remain v1356. The completed
route uses frozen consumer491/`d25ba16e…`. Actual Bomb probes use archived
consumer492/`3135f76e…`; handoff formatting changes only that Python probe's
layout, preserves its AST, and freezes current492/`4ed57dab…` separately.
Do not restamp old runtime receipts with current source identities.

Primary native receipts: `.analysis/port64/bomb-input-v1362/` (completed route,
independent-natural-v1364.json, actual-rescues-v1364.json) and
`.analysis/port64/bomb-window-v1364/` (early/late/failed probes, independent
readback, both492-input source snapshots). All paths here are relative to the
native worktree. See its `docs/port64/evidence/host-window.md` for replay details.

## Comparison priority for the next agent

The user's primary comparison is **original Japanese DOS versus reconstructed
DOS**, both through the PC-98 game route. Native x64 must also preserve gameplay
state and effects. Native-host equality and successful native clears do not
replace either comparison. Start with the four bundled demos, then bounded
recorded ordinary play; compare score, consumed input, RNG and actor state at
the same logical boundary, followed by VRAM/palette/effects and process/save
transitions. See [DOS/native differential handoff](../../../../docs/reconstruction/product/TH04_REPLAY_DIFFERENTIAL.md).

TH08 is a read-only workflow reference, not TH04 evidence. Its active worktree
is dirty; do not edit it, run its builds, change its database or launch its game.
Complete trace/end/input-consumption guards and first-divergence diagnostics
are the useful parts to adapt. TH04 still lacks complete paired original-DOS /
reconstructed-DOS gameplay traces; current native host traces do not include
RNG seed/ring/call-count fields. These are concrete next-work gaps.

## Replay and finish

```sh
python3 scripts/preflight.py
python3 scripts/ci.py
git diff --check
```

Use [status](PORT64.md), [host-window evidence](port64/evidence/host-window.md)
and [retention](ANALYSIS_RETENTION.md). Source/program/profile archives retain
producer identities; restore into fresh paths. One Borland/Wine writer at a
time. Never open an audio backend/device in these validations.
