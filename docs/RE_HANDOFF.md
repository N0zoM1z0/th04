# TH04 current handoff

The user is actively using the Windows host. Do not launch Windows GUI
tests, activate foreground windows or inject host keys. Keep every launch
muted; use headless checks or private Linux Xvfb instead. Actual Windows
window/input acceptance stays open under this constraint.

The v1365 DOS demo batch has complete original/ordinary-candidate captures:
Demo2/3/4 pass the sampled input/score/RNG boundary; Demo1 first differs at3343.
Read-only actor snapshots show earlier bullet-angle differences and one extra
candidate graze. Preserve the failed comparison; no product source or accepted
exact state changes. The separate native worktree remains untouched.
Private emulator builds/captures use one CPU, nice15 and bounded memory;
generated object/archive retirement readback verifies524 absent files and five
protected hashes,814,161,920 allocated B freed. Runtime/source receipts remain.
Final root CI passes, including live Ghidra replay/mutations;16 focused controls
pass. Failed-startup copies and512 source-backed caches additionally retire
51,986,432 allocated B with independent protected-hash readback. No games remain
running; no native C++ rebuild or Windows GUI/audio launch occurs.
Current commit identities are obtained with `git log -1` in each worktree.

Updated 2026-10-10. Current focus: Demo1 bullet generation before score/RNG
divergence, followed by separate x64 state/effect fidelity. DOS demo state is retained. This handoff
indexes verified state; detailed experiments belong in focused notes and CSV
ledgers. The next behavioral validation focus is original DOS versus reconstructed
DOS, with native x64 fidelity checked separately. Reopen semantic work for a
reproduced differential or a concrete portable owner, not a general rename pass.

## Products and claim boundaries

| Product | State | Authority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Historical reconstruction | OP 93/93, MAIN 493/495, MAINE 72/72, ZUN 3/3 accepted authored functions | [Generated progress](PROGRESS.md), acceptance ledgers |
| Standalone DOS PC-98 game | Four products build from maintained local source without master.lib or ReC98 product includes; repaired normal and invincible variants | [DOS operation](DOS_BUILD.md), [hardware findings](PC98_HARDWARE_REUSE.md) |
| Semantic DOS source | Asset, memory, input/timing, scroll, bullet/VM/shot/item, RNG, score and process contracts clarified | [Semantic summary](SEMANTIC_READABILITY.md) |
| Linux/Windows x64 | Separate `port/modern-64` branch; component-tested normal stages and cutscenes; complete game still unfinished | [Port status and TODO](PORTING_STATUS.md) |

Function acceptance is not whole-file exactness. OP/MAINE/ZUN counts cover
recovered payload functions, not original packed-file extents. MAIN's carpet
and checkerboard cases remain deferred; no acceptance is promoted by the
native fixes or this runtime batch. Targets remain
`candidate-local-attested` (a provenance gap).

## DOS verification frontier

- v1365 original/ordinary DOS naturally rotates all four demos through GAME.BAT.
  Each has3996 update boundaries plus terminal condition3996; Demo2/3/4 match
  all3997 sampled rows. Demo1 agrees through3342, then score/pending delta,
  ring cursor and helper events diverge at3343. Candidate adds two
  `randring2_next16_and(31)` calls from `sparks_add_random` (MAIN156A:03E6
  return). LCG, consumed input and sampled player lifecycle still agree there.
  Diagnostic snapshots at the earlier stage-frame write show graze59/60 and
  48 differing live bullets. At snapshot3331, newly generated slots392..415
  already have equal origins but angles5A/46 versus61/3F; slots416..439 differ
  by snapshot3330. This is not the earliest complete actor divergence.
  Original MAIN load10FC / DGROUP3230; candidate load10FC / DGROUP34F7.
  See [paired demo evidence and replay commands](reconstruction/product/TH04_REPLAY_DIFFERENTIAL.md).
- The user reports complete Normal routes/Endings/save and earlier invincible
  Easy/Lunatic runs. These are manual Windows observations.
- Recorded ordinary controls cover startup, OP options/Music Room/config
  persistence, Orange clear, Stage 2 entry, the repaired Kurumi empty-ring
  failure and Stage 3 entry. Seeded Good Endings reach registration and save
  the expected section; their final black frames do not accept fresh OP.
- Upper-left pellet corruption is confirmed and repaired by full EAX clearing;
  seven ordinary checkpoints exclude the old mark. The Stage 6 stripe's
  connection to initial scroll state remains inferred, with user confirmation
  that the stripe disappeared.
- Scalar/CPU/I-O controls reject planar and bullet drawing regressions. A
  440-bullet Lunatic/Turbo fixture measures improvement, including the extreme
  all-cloud phase. It is not a natural full Lunatic route or Windows FPS test.
- Full natural dense Lunatic timing/audio, the optional Windows 36,000-cycle
  profile and a second PC-98 emulator remain validation TODOs. New DOS
  performance work is outside the current native batch.

See [reusable hardware contracts and limits](PC98_HARDWARE_REUSE.md) for each
repair, replay entrypoint and evidence/knowledge routing.

## Native x64 frontier

The v1362 GNU Reimu A / Lunatic / Turbo0 candidate is now terminal and
accepted by the independent `verify_natural_slowdown.py` reader: 88,249 route
refreshes plus 792 refreshes in a separate Scores process. It reaches all six
stages without Continue, exits registration by Esc, returns to fresh OP, and
stores real section3 clear mask1 at the physical rename and final file. The nine
other decoded score partitions and CFG stay unchanged; no pending file remains.
Final MAIN: stage5/frame13,649, lives7, misses6, score units5,597,294.

Natural density reaches439 bullets. At >=320 there are571 refreshes/287
slowdown2; at >=400 there are240/129. Complete deadlines/terminal counts pass.
At >=400, update P95/P99/max are6.61/8.50/13.37ms with no update exceeding its
own admission period. This is instrumented GNU/private-Xvfb/shared-WSL evidence;
uninstrumented physical FPS and original DOS parity remain unaccepted. Generic
traces do not expose every inner Ending phase. Audio opens remain zero.

Two actual ordinary X early-hit cancellations occur in Stage4, preserving miss
count while consuming stock, starting Bomb, clearing respawn and setting
invincibility255. The last-life proactive policy branch remains dry-controlled
only. Separate ordinary window probes pass early/closed cases (1,039/1,048
refreshes): early X cancels frame394 hit at395; closed-window X at401 remains
rejected at404 (stock2, Bomb inactive, miss1, respawn61). The first late probe
stays failed: its cleanup incorrectly expected MAIN Esc to return to OP, while
the host Escape handler exits MAIN directly. This is a probe cleanup failure,
not a demonstrated Bomb failure or original Escape-parity acceptance.

Retained GNU Reimu A routes:

| Route | Route + independent Scores refreshes | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Normal/Turbo1 | 89,008 +794 | Six stages/noContinue, physical clear/freshOP/restart |
| Lunatic/Turbo1 | 88,927 +790 | Physical clear; dense slowdown2 absent |
| Lunatic/Turbo0 | 88,249 +792 | Physical clear plus natural dense slowdown2 gates |
| Extra | 30,388 +790 | NoContinue, full eight A gaiji, physical clear/restart |

Prior UBSan Normal all-clear acceptance is revoked: mask0x19 is an unplayed
sentinel even though bit0 is set. The v1360 GNU Turbo0 attempt also stays failed
(88,267 refreshes, Final Stage miss13, masks0x19); its separate795-refresh
Scores reader and bounded dense slowdown observations remain valid. Require
mask<4 plus the selected shot bit, never bit0 alone. All these jobs are terminal;
do not poll or revive dated PID/tool handles from historical active-job files.

Registration, lifecycle/Continue/HUD, stage/Ending/Extra, score/config, demo,
MusicRoom/unlocks and muted sound owners have separate component/integration
evidence. Eight actual GNU/UBSan Continue cases and ten GNU setup/corrupt-file
cases are retained. Startup combinations cover27 GNU/UBSan and19 earlier
Windows cases. Broader character/shot/rank/Ending/Extra routes, actual Windows
display/input, physical audio and uninstrumented performance remain open.

No C++ rebuild: compiled producer485 inputs/`00af24f7…`, GNU game
`dbe17225…`, UBSan `029e7ba1…`, Windows `5b6cf2c3…` remain v1356. The completed
route uses frozen consumer491/`d25ba16e…`. Actual Bomb probes use archived
consumer492/`3135f76e…`; handoff formatting changes only that Python probe's
layout, preserves its AST, and freezes current492/`4ed57dab…` separately.
Do not restamp old runtime receipts with current source identities.

Primary native receipts: `.analysis/port64/bomb-input-v1362/` (completed route,
independent-natural-v1364.json, actual-rescues-v1364.json) and
`.analysis/port64/bomb-window-v1364/` (early/late/failed probes, independent
readback, both492-input source snapshots). All paths here are relative to the
native worktree. See its `docs/port64/evidence/host-window.md` for replay details.

## Comparison priority for the next agent

The user's primary comparison is **original Japanese DOS versus reconstructed
DOS**, both through the PC-98 game route. Native x64 must also preserve gameplay
state and effects. Native-host equality and successful native clears do not
replace either comparison. Start with the four bundled demos, then bounded
recorded ordinary play; compare score, consumed input, RNG and actor state at
the same logical boundary, followed by VRAM/palette/effects and process/save
transitions. See [DOS/native differential handoff](reconstruction/product/TH04_REPLAY_DIFFERENTIAL.md).

TH08 is a read-only workflow reference, not TH04 evidence. Its active worktree
is dirty; do not edit it, run its builds, change its database or launch its game.
Complete trace/end/input-consumption guards and first-divergence diagnostics
are the useful parts to adapt. Complete DOS demo captures now exist, with a
specific failed Demo1 frontier. Full actor/presentation/process parity and
native RNG seed/ring/call-count observations remain open.

## Windows DOS demo package

The demo directory retains `start-th04-normal.bat` (ordinary damage) and
`start-th04.bat` (separately compiled invincible MAIN), plus their two unchanged
images/products, standard 24,000-cycle profiles, emulator/font and English
source builder. Independent saves are preserved by full-image hash readback.
Native previews and optional launchers are archived outside that directory.
Windows `Build-TH04.ps1 -CheckOnly -Normal` passes; no rebuild or game launch
was performed. See [retention](ANALYSIS_RETENTION.md) for recovery.
