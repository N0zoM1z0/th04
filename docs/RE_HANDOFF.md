# TH04 current handoff

Updated 2026-10-10. Current focus: resumed x64 implementation on its separate
branch; DOS demo state is retained. This handoff
indexes verified state; detailed experiments belong in focused notes and CSV
ledgers. General semantic work has reached its stopping condition: resume it
only for an ambiguity that blocks a concrete native port owner.

## Products and claim boundaries

| Product | State | Authority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Historical reconstruction | OP 93/93, MAIN 493/495, MAINE 72/72, ZUN 3/3 accepted authored functions | [Generated progress](PROGRESS.md), acceptance ledgers |
| Standalone DOS PC-98 game | Four products build from maintained local source without master.lib or ReC98 product includes; repaired normal and invincible variants | [DOS operation](DOS_BUILD.md), [hardware findings](PC98_HARDWARE_REUSE.md) |
| Semantic DOS source | Asset, memory, input/timing, scroll, bullet/VM/shot/item, RNG, score and process contracts clarified | [Semantic summary](SEMANTIC_READABILITY.md) |
| Linux/Windows x64 | Separate `port/modern-64` branch; component-tested normal stages and cutscenes; complete game still unfinished | [Port status and TODO](PORTING_STATUS.md) |

Function acceptance is not whole-file exactness. OP/MAINE/ZUN counts cover
recovered payload functions, not original packed-file extents. MAIN's carpet
and checkerboard cases remain deferred; no acceptance is promoted by the
native fixes or this documentation cleanup. Targets remain
`candidate-local-attested` (a provenance gap).

## DOS verification frontier

- The user reports complete Normal routes/Endings/save and earlier invincible
  Easy/Lunatic runs. These are manual Windows observations.
- Recorded ordinary controls cover startup, OP options/Music Room/config
  persistence, Orange clear, Stage 2 entry, the repaired Kurumi empty-ring
  failure and Stage 3 entry. Seeded Good Endings reach registration and save
  the expected section; their final black frames do not accept fresh OP.
- Upper-left pellet corruption is confirmed and repaired by full EAX clearing;
  seven ordinary checkpoints exclude the old mark. The Stage 6 stripe's
  connection to initial scroll state remains inferred, with user confirmation
  that the stripe disappeared.
- Scalar/CPU/I-O controls reject planar and bullet drawing regressions. A
  440-bullet Lunatic/Turbo fixture measures improvement, including the extreme
  all-cloud phase. It is not a natural full Lunatic route or Windows FPS test.
- Full natural dense Lunatic timing/audio, the optional Windows 36,000-cycle
  profile and a second PC-98 emulator remain validation TODOs. New DOS
  performance work is outside the current native batch.

See [reusable hardware contracts and limits](PC98_HARDWARE_REUSE.md) for each
repair, replay entrypoint and evidence/knowledge routing.

## Native x64 frontier

v1341 adds resident master-cycle scheduling and rational nanosecond time.
GNU8, optimized UBSan and actual Windows each match 283,494 complete original
rows in 174 scenarios across two PSPs and three drivers. Windows executes 87
unique traces/141,747 rows and compares both original loads. All 60 component
contracts pass per host. 430 inputs bind 183 AMD64 products. Independent
pinned ymfm also matches 2,448 cold-chip rows across three boards/16 initial B
phases; time partitions retain 1,285 complete IRQ rows. Five source-only
variants reject; an equivalent variant is retained as inconclusive. Prior
timer-register 80,040 rows replay per GNU/UBSan. All producer/consumer handles
are terminal zero. Disjoint cleanup reclaims 1,018,875,904 allocated bytes
(971.7 MiB) while preserving current products and replay evidence.
Receipts: native `.analysis/port64/pmd-time-v1341/`; details: native
`docs/port64/evidence/pmd-clock.md`.

Current source manifest:
`e5f6d215587b8fe1258b62443a9cbfac3f710fe7db4d9f6d21cc3d0d2fd7440a`.
Acknowledge and tempo writes preserve live deadlines; overflow reloads before
IRQ work; music stop/restart retains resident phase. Nanoseconds retain their
rational remainder. Frequency, initial FM epoch and coincident zero-latency
IRQ remain explicit adapters, not physical board timing acceptance.
Synthesis, other required driver owners, actual resident frontend lifetime,
capability/measure waits and full startup remain unfinished. All runs stay
muted with no audio device/backend. Linux GUI hashes are unchanged; Windows
relinks have bounded CPU controls only. No new GUI or natural-route acceptance
occurs. DOS acceptance and candidate-local-attested provenance are unchanged.


Normal six-stage/MAINE, registration/host score/fresh OP,
death/Bomb/Game Over/Continue, Extra actor routes, HUD/unlocks/Scores,
Music Room, demos and configuration/setup are joined under bounded controls.
Extra and the long Ending actor controls disable hit consumption; complete
natural survival remains separate. The last published native GUI remains the
archived v1296 package. See [port status](PORTING_STATUS.md) and the native
branch handoff for the current queue.

Next finish audio ownership while muted, then full ordinary/Extra routes on
Linux/Windows, saves/restarts, refresh/input/slowdown and dense Lunatic timing.
MAIN's two deferred exactness cases do not gate native functionality.

## Windows DOS demo package

The demo directory retains `start-th04-normal.bat` (ordinary damage) and
`start-th04.bat` (separately compiled invincible MAIN), plus their two unchanged
images/products, standard 24,000-cycle profiles, emulator/font and English
source builder. Independent saves are preserved by full-image hash readback.
Native previews and optional launchers are archived outside that directory.
Windows `Build-TH04.ps1 -CheckOnly -Normal` passes; no rebuild or game launch
was performed. See [retention](ANALYSIS_RETENTION.md) for recovery.

## Navigation

- [Documentation map](README.md), [architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md),
  [workflow](RE_WORKFLOW.md), [source layout](SOURCE_LAYOUT.md).
- [Evidence index](reconstruction/README.md), [knowledge policy](KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md).
- `config/units.csv`, authored/decoded function ledgers: accepted ownership.
- `config/evidence.csv`, `config/knowledge.csv`: observations and reusable findings.

Historical handoff detail is retained in Git (pre-cleanup `a4f7991`) and the
subject notes. Old build/package names and private receipt paths are provenance,
not the current work queue or a promise of expanded artifact retention.
