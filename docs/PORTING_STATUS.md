# Semantic and x64 port status

The user is actively using the Windows host. Do not launch Windows GUI
tests, activate foreground windows or inject host keys. Keep every launch
muted; use headless checks or private Linux Xvfb instead. Actual Windows
window/input acceptance stays open under this constraint.

Updated 2026-10-11. The full native goal remains active on `port/modern-64`, in
`.analysis/worktrees/port-modern-64/`. Root `main` keeps the standalone DOS
product and indexes native findings. A root `git push` does not commit or push
native worktree changes.

## Current products and acceptance

| Product | Accepted scope | Remaining boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Historical reconstruction | OP 93/93, MAIN 493/495, MAINE 72/72, ZUN 3/3 authored functions | Function acceptance is not whole-file exactness; MAIN carpet/checkerboard deferred |
| Standalone PC-98 DOS | Four local-source products, repaired normal/invincible packages; user reports complete Normal routes/save | Automated natural dense Lunatic, timing/audio and second-emulator coverage remain separate |
| Semantic readable | Assets, heap, input/timing, scroll, bullets/VM/shots/items, RNG, score and process contracts clarified | Resume only for a concrete native blocker; old exact replay failures remain failed |
| Native x64 | Typed Linux/Windows gameplay, renderer, asset, lifecycle, persistence and sound owners with scoped Oracles | Full physical host/game-route acceptance remains open |

Target files pass local identity/format checks but remain
`candidate-local-attested`; external pristine-dump provenance is unresolved.
No native observation promotes a historical exact unit.

## Native progress

The v1362 GNU Reimu A / Lunatic / Turbo0 candidate is now terminal and
accepted by the independent `verify_natural_slowdown.py` reader: 88,249 route
refreshes plus 792 refreshes in a separate Scores process. It reaches all six
stages without Continue, exits registration by Esc, returns to fresh OP, and
stores real section3 clear mask1 at the physical rename and final file. The nine
other decoded score partitions and CFG stay unchanged; no pending file remains.
Final MAIN: stage5/frame13,649, lives7, misses6, score units5,597,294.

Natural density reaches439 bullets. At >=320 there are571 refreshes/287
slowdown2; at >=400 there are240/129. Complete deadlines/terminal counts pass.
At >=400, update P95/P99/max are6.61/8.50/13.37ms with no update exceeding its
own admission period. This is instrumented GNU/private-Xvfb/shared-WSL evidence;
uninstrumented physical FPS and original DOS parity remain unaccepted. Generic
traces do not expose every inner Ending phase. Audio opens remain zero.

Two actual ordinary X early-hit cancellations occur in Stage4, preserving miss
count while consuming stock, starting Bomb, clearing respawn and setting
invincibility255. The last-life proactive policy branch remains dry-controlled
only. Separate ordinary window probes pass early/closed cases (1,039/1,048
refreshes): early X cancels frame394 hit at395; closed-window X at401 remains
rejected at404 (stock2, Bomb inactive, miss1, respawn61). The first late probe
stays failed: its cleanup incorrectly expected MAIN Esc to return to OP, while
the host Escape handler exits MAIN directly. This is a probe cleanup failure,
not a demonstrated Bomb failure or original Escape-parity acceptance.

Retained GNU Reimu A routes:

| Route | Route + independent Scores refreshes | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Normal/Turbo1 | 89,008 +794 | Six stages/noContinue, physical clear/freshOP/restart |
| Lunatic/Turbo1 | 88,927 +790 | Physical clear; dense slowdown2 absent |
| Lunatic/Turbo0 | 88,249 +792 | Physical clear plus natural dense slowdown2 gates |
| Extra | 30,388 +790 | NoContinue, full eight A gaiji, physical clear/restart |

Prior UBSan Normal all-clear acceptance is revoked: mask0x19 is an unplayed
sentinel even though bit0 is set. The v1360 GNU Turbo0 attempt also stays failed
(88,267 refreshes, Final Stage miss13, masks0x19); its separate795-refresh
Scores reader and bounded dense slowdown observations remain valid. Require
mask<4 plus the selected shot bit, never bit0 alone. All these jobs are terminal;
do not poll or revive dated PID/tool handles from historical active-job files.

Registration, lifecycle/Continue/HUD, stage/Ending/Extra, score/config, demo,
MusicRoom/unlocks and muted sound owners have separate component/integration
evidence. Eight actual GNU/UBSan Continue cases and ten GNU setup/corrupt-file
cases are retained. Startup combinations cover27 GNU/UBSan and19 earlier
Windows cases. Broader character/shot/rank/Ending/Extra routes, actual Windows
display/input, physical audio and uninstrumented performance remain open.

No C++ rebuild: compiled producer485 inputs/`00af24f7…`, GNU game
`dbe17225…`, UBSan `029e7ba1…`, Windows `5b6cf2c3…` remain v1356. The completed
route uses frozen consumer491/`d25ba16e…`. Actual Bomb probes use archived
consumer492/`3135f76e…`; handoff formatting changes only that Python probe's
layout, preserves its AST, and freezes current492/`4ed57dab…` separately.
Do not restamp old runtime receipts with current source identities.

Primary native receipts: `.analysis/port64/bomb-input-v1362/` (completed route,
independent-natural-v1364.json, actual-rescues-v1364.json) and
`.analysis/port64/bomb-window-v1364/` (early/late/failed probes, independent
readback, both492-input source snapshots). All paths here are relative to the
native worktree. See its `docs/port64/evidence/host-window.md` for replay details.

## Comparison priority for the next agent

The user's primary comparison is **original Japanese DOS versus reconstructed
DOS**, both through the PC-98 game route. Native x64 must also preserve gameplay
state and effects. Native-host equality and successful native clears do not
replace either comparison. Start with the four bundled demos, then bounded
recorded ordinary play; compare score, consumed input, RNG and actor state at
the same logical boundary, followed by VRAM/palette/effects and process/save
transitions. See [DOS/native differential handoff](reconstruction/product/TH04_REPLAY_DIFFERENTIAL.md).

TH08 is a read-only workflow reference, not TH04 evidence. Its active worktree
is dirty; do not edit it, run its builds, change its database or launch its game.
Complete trace/end/input-consumption guards and first-divergence diagnostics
are the useful parts to adapt. All four paired DOS demo traces now pass their
full input/score/RNG schema, nine raw actor/effect pools and 22 Boss/Midboss/player
state blocks. Retained DGROUP streams cover3996 updates per demo; scalar traces
also retain each terminal decision. Boss state stays at setup throughout these
demos; death and respawn are not exercised. Other globals, Boss combat,
VRAM/palette and process teardown remain comparison gaps. Current native host
traces still lack complete RNG seed/ring/call-count fields and paired
original-DOS gameplay evidence.

## TODO, in order

1. Extend accepted four-demo original/reconstructed DOS comparison to other
   global owners, VRAM/palette and process teardown, then recorded ordinary play
   covering Boss combat and death/respawn. Preserve identical data/config/saves,
   logical input, complete-trace gates and first-divergence diagnostics.
2. Extend the same comparison to native x64. Attest input mapping, RNG ring and
   process state, score units, update order and dialogue boundaries; then compare
   rendering/effects, VRAM/palette and save/process transitions.
3. Expand native full routes across characters/shots/ranks/Endings/Continue and
   Extra. Current accepted GNU Reimu A routes do not cover every combination.
4. Verify uninstrumented natural dense Lunatic performance and broader host
   pacing. The completed Turbo0 instrumented route closes its scoped dense gate.
5. Actual Windows display/input and physical audio remain unavailable under the
   user's no-host-GUI/no-device constraint. Do not launch or work around it.

Historical exactness remains a separate ledger. The two deferred MAIN cases
are not prerequisites for this behavioral comparison.

## Delivery and storage

A fresh experimental current GUI is installed at
`/mnt/d/Entertainment/Game/Touhou/th04-reconstruct/native-port64-v1354/`.
`start-muted.bat` and `start-linux-muted.sh` explicitly mute; independent host
saves and Normal/3-life/2-Bomb defaults preserve all 21 preceding DOS/package
files. Source archives/profiles accompany the binaries. Windows input automation
remains rejected; physical audio, dense timing and full-goal acceptance remain.

v1355 scoped cleanup keeps all 204 programs, producer/consumer source archives,
compiler/CMake metadata, traces, physical files, captures and failed attempts.
It retires 1190 regenerable build files / 70 completed contract-stage files after
two full recovery archives / 144 members read back, net 596836352 allocated bytes.
An independent replay verifies 2847 protected hashes and all 1260 absent files.
The three earlier desktop stages retire 20 files, net 35110912 bytes; the terminal
GUI stage and archived failed consumer materialization retire 494 files,
net 22450176 bytes. Immutable capture sharing keeps 324 complete BMP/PCM paths
and hashes, net 210509824 bytes. Counts subtract their journals/archives but
exclude final receipt size. No original input, accepted program or save deleted.
Post-CI pruning retires 1020 source-backed Python caches, net 16822272 allocated
bytes; root `.analysis/cleanup/host-route-post-ci-caches-v1355.json` records
source/hash readback. Both CIs pass, including root live Ghidra replay/mutations.

Follow [retention](ANALYSIS_RETENTION.md); never blanket-delete `.analysis/`.

Detailed historical batch evidence remains in ledgers, subject notes and Git.
Use [handoff](RE_HANDOFF.md), [semantic contracts](SEMANTIC_READABILITY.md) and
`python3 scripts/status.py` for current authority instead of old progress labels.
