# TH04 native x64 port

`port/modern-64` is a separate product based on the semantic DOS source. The
DOS build remains the behavioral reference and keeps its own Borland/TASM
acceptance rules. The portable product uses fixed-width state, ordinary host
pointers and host backends; it does not claim byte equality with PC-98 code.

## Current executable slice

`port64/main.cpp` currently owns the read-only resource path: TH04 HDI FAT12,
PAR directory/decompression and 16-color PI decoding. `port64/view.cpp` owns
the first graphics boundary. It decodes mask-only and combined CD2 sheets,
composes the recovered OP main and Options layouts at 640x400, writes
deterministic BMPs, and opens an SDL2/Linux or Win32/GDI window. The user
supplies the original HDI or loose OP archive at runtime.

`port64/menu_state.cpp` owns fixed-width host state for the six main commands
and eight option rows. It preserves the locked-Extra skip, main/options return
selection, rank/lives/bombs/BGM/SE wrap directions, Turbo toggle and reset
defaults. Host key events call this state instead of embedding transitions in
SDL or Win32 code. Main commands beyond Options and Quit still report that
their destination is unported. Descriptions, character selection, idle demos,
sound and configuration persistence remain to be migrated.

`port64/application_state.cpp` now owns the first executable-handoff boundary.
It replaces DOS process/segment mechanics with one fixed-width resident object
and guarded `OP -> MAIN -> MAINE -> OP` state transitions. Normal and Extra
starts preserve their configurable/fixed resources; demos retain the original
four stage/character/shot contracts and the split live/resource stage fields.
MAIN publishes score and run counters before either returning to OP or entering
MAINE. MAINE classifies Good/Bad, Extra and score-only routes from the original
one-byte sentinel values, retaining the Good/Bad script selector, before
returning to OP. A generation counter marks each fresh executable-local
resource lifetime. No gameplay or score-file I/O is implied by this
control-plane slice.

The first gameplay contract is separated into
`src/main/bullet/group_types.hpp` and `port64/bullet_geometry.cpp`. Both DOS
and portable sources share the numeric group and 8-bit clockwise angle
definitions. Portable persistent group storage is explicitly one byte.
Deterministic tests cover odd/even spread order, accumulator wrapping, rings,
aim plus template rotation, directional sprite cels and rejection of a zero
ring count. Speed state remains outside this bounded slice.

`port64/random_lcg.cpp` owns the process-local 32-bit generator. Its unsigned
update reproduces TC4J's modulo arithmetic and 15-bit result without depending
on host `long` width or signed overflow. `application_state.cpp` separately
stores the resident OP menu-frame accumulator, resets local state to 1 for a
new modeled executable, copies the resident seed into MAIN, applies demo seed
318, and re-seeds MAINE only when verdict calculation begins. This retains the
Bad/Good versus Extra/score-only save-order distinction.

`port64/random_ring.cpp` owns the following random-state boundary. One
`SharedRandomRing` replaces both historical accessor copies and preserves
their shared call order. Its contract covers the descending 256-byte fill,
overlapping little-endian word samples, low-byte-only cursor increment,
AND/MOD reduction after consumption and the index-255 sample whose high byte
is the pre-increment cursor value `0xFF`. The implementation synthesizes that
boundary value without an out-of-bounds C++ load. A zero MOD divisor throws
after consuming the sample, providing a defined host failure at the same state
boundary as the original 8086 `DIV` exception. Its production fill now consumes
`Lcg32` directly. Connecting direct spark/item calls and the remaining gameplay
sites stays separate work.

`port64/item_system.cpp` is the first fixed-pool gameplay state built on those
random contracts. It preserves the byte automatic-drop counter, every-second
64-entry table lookup, first-free pool allocation, miss-drop spread selection,
the discarded distinct-slot draw, conditional per-item type draws and the
last-life override order. Its scorer uses explicit 8/16/32-bit state for power,
dream, point totals and performance accumulators. The full-power big-item path
branches before table access while retaining the historical final cap of 42,
2,560-point reward and yellow popup, so x64 never reproduces the DOS
pre-clamp out-of-range read. The pickup helper performs the historical wrapped
unsigned 16-bit rectangle test without host signed overflow. Rendering, sprite
pool motion and HUD/audio adapters remain outside this bounded contract.

## Verified builds

The same source builds and runs as Linux ELF64 x86-64 and Windows PE32+
x86-64. Both decode the attested HDI fixtures with packed-pixel FNV32 values
`232AE649` and `EDFA0534`. Both produce the same title BMP, SHA-256
`b52ea8615865bfc11945fbe23828b7c391d8424c998062a8abfb5d62b4b31d2a`.
Both also produce the same default Options BMP, SHA-256
`a064338b0cfb89f7e418a85ab6bc84a7ea5ef835e4ca995b68772e0aef368185`.
Both portable contract executables report `pointer_bits=64`, `angle_bits=8`,
`menu_state=OP`, `handoff_state=OP_MAIN_MAINE` and
`randring=SHARED_OVERLAP`, `lcg=PROCESS_LOCAL32` and
`items=FIXED_WIDTH_SAFE`.
A separate GNU x86-64 build passes the same contract with undefined-behavior
and array-bounds instrumentation enabled.

The item-contract verification receipt is
`.analysis/port64/verification-items-v1249/receipt.json` (SHA-256
`e6dfefcb396735ae7a42c2bf7a641c728bed907ab5cf9185c4eea1dd1f2f9aee`),
with source manifest
`b28fdc6701bb4d14d497d1263cf4ec0eee349a33a67b03057929453bcb21579f`.
The UBSan/bounds receipt is
`.analysis/port64/ubsan-items-v1249/receipt.json` (SHA-256
`eb0551c7c51a148d493a7b9f9fe6f398abc1a3b3983b2ed84f34fe81cf8ef6ce`).

Replay the complete cross-build check with:

```sh
python3 port64/verify.py \
  --linux-dir .analysis/port64/linux \
  --windows-dir .analysis/port64/windows \
  --hdi .analysis/runtime/images/zun.hdi \
  --output .analysis/port64/verification/receipt.json
```

The private receipt records executable format and hashes, the source manifest,
resource outputs and the HDI digest. It never copies game assets into the
repository.

## Migration order

1. Split the resource services behind reusable host interfaces while retaining
   the verified byte/pixel controls.
2. Add description text, character selection and explicit frame/input timing
   to the portable main/options state and framebuffer backend.
3. Connect the verified process-transition contract to UI destinations, then
   add audio and saved configuration adapters.
4. Connect the fixed-width item contract to a MAIN entity pool and rendering,
   then port the remaining direct spark/bullet random call sites without
   splitting the process LCG or shared ring sequence.
5. Add route-level differential checkpoints for gameplay, Ending and score
   persistence on Linux and Windows.
