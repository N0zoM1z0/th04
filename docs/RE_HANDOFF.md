# TH04 current handoff

The user is actively using the Windows host. Do not launch Windows GUI
tests, activate foreground windows or inject host keys. Keep every launch
muted; use headless checks or private Linux Xvfb instead. Actual Windows
window/input acceptance stays open under this constraint.

v1394 (native evidence `de21a71`) isolates original Gaiji I/O work. Four read-only GAME.BAT/PMD86 captures
cross fixed CPU budgets 24,000 / 36,000 with default / zero 8-bit I/O delay.
Other configuration bytes, original HDI/reset/assets/font/emulator are identical.
Each full 69,028-byte OP load and 804 ordered relocations agrees with the pinned
decoded target. Load 10FC, DGROUP 2030; nine attested points yield 264 scalar
rows including 256 read-glyph entries. Complete GDC model replay, port tables,
raw PIC arithmetic and load/port/time/GDC mutation rejection pass. Controlled
host stop at OP 0A74:0C79, before the next instruction, is not process completion.

Gaiji 0A74:0C6B→0C79 takes 40.235458 / 34.996667 ms with default I/O delay,
versus 17.134000 / 11.404611 ms when only 8-bit delay is zero. Actual read-all
0:1450→1471 and write-all 0:14BE→14E1 have 8,192 reads and 25,604 writes
including selectors. Default delay [864,559,1118] ns and pinned integer debit
arithmetic account for 22.829167 / 23.412333 ms of Gaiji-only work. Separate
aggregate removed-cycle remainders remain recorded; zero-delay window debits
are zero. CPU-normalized zero-delay ratio is 1.001591. This identifies the
principal DOSBox-X I/O owner, not a physical ISA/CGROM delay or native constant.

Three failed observer attempts retain their logs/partial streams and are
rejected as incomplete: pre-guest Python indentation; a local window splitting
an MZ relocation at 0A74:0C70; and the pinned DGROUP guard rejecting borrowed-DS
write-glyph 0:1474. The accepted observer expands the relocation window and
uses host I/O counters enabled only in the two transfer windows. Original
emulator guards and target bytes remain unchanged.

Native source is unchanged at 510-file producer
9cfe100a84ac0a325d498b9b81602298009e462643b2cfa453947fe85bc1b049.
Retained v1392 GNU/UBSan build, Demo and private Xvfb proofs retain their
identities; no native build/runtime acceptance is rerun here. v1393 observed
Logo PI loading/drawing and supplied-age/zero-age diagnostics remain distinct.
Native assets load in port64/main.cpp before resident PMD construction in
port64/view.cpp; DOS installation precedes OP loading. Next implement explicit
elapsed-work ownership through resources, drawing and process entry, with
independent diagnostics before changing default clocks. Do not fit an emulator
bus cost, fixed startup age or display-event count into product behavior.

Lossless content deduplication retires 49 logical files into 15 unique blobs,
reclaiming 604.43 MiB across this batch. Entire gzip CRC/EOF, logical member
SHA/size/mode/nsmtime and protected proof checks precede removal. The earlier
temporary archive container is retired after all its logical members verify;
compressed wrapper bytes are not a replay claim. Raw completed/failed inner
captures, scripts, receipts and logs remain immutable and live. Build outputs
were not generated. Both full CI gates pass (root 441 / native 345 tests),
with ledger and diff checks. Source-backed post-CI caches reclaim 16.69 MiB.

Goal remains active; MAIN historical carpet/checkerboard exactness is deferred,
targets remain candidate-local-attested and DOS fingerprint 6f5898dd is unchanged.
Full default pictures, broader paired combat/process, physical/cross-emulator
scanout and Windows input/audio remain open. Continue CPU0/nice19 serial muted
Linux work; Windows GUI/focus/host keys remain excluded.

See the focused differential note for detailed evidence and prior proof limits.

Earlier native shake, background-ring, laser, pellet, item-splash and MPN
palette repairs retain their frozen producer/proof identities. The
[focused differential note](reconstruction/product/TH04_REPLAY_DIFFERENTIAL.md)
indexes their results and archive recovery; they cannot attest the current
source without a fresh scoped replay.

Updated 2026-10-11. Current focus: complete DOS actor/presentation/process
comparison, followed by separate x64 state/effect fidelity. DOS demo state is
retained. This handoff indexes verified state; detailed experiments belong in focused notes and CSV
ledgers. The next behavioral validation focus is original DOS versus reconstructed
DOS, with native x64 fidelity checked separately. Reopen semantic work for a
reproduced differential or a concrete portable owner, not a general rename pass.

## Products and claim boundaries

| Product | State | Authority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Historical reconstruction | OP 93/93, MAIN 493/495, MAINE 72/72, ZUN 3/3 accepted authored functions | [Generated progress](PROGRESS.md), acceptance ledgers |
| Standalone DOS PC-98 game | Four products build from maintained local source without master.lib or ReC98 product includes; repaired normal and invincible variants | [DOS operation](DOS_BUILD.md), [hardware findings](PC98_HARDWARE_REUSE.md) |
| Semantic DOS source | Asset, memory, input/timing, scroll, bullet/VM/shot/item, RNG, score and process contracts clarified | [Semantic summary](SEMANTIC_READABILITY.md) |
| Linux/Windows x64 | Separate `port/modern-64` branch; scoped GNU Reimu A Normal/Lunatic/Extra clear/save/restart routes plus component Oracles; full fidelity still open | [Port status and TODO](PORTING_STATUS.md) |

Function acceptance is not whole-file exactness. OP/MAINE/ZUN counts cover
recovered payload functions, not original packed-file extents. MAIN's carpet
and checkerboard cases remain deferred; no acceptance is promoted by the
native fixes or this runtime batch. Targets remain
`candidate-local-attested` (a provenance gap).

## DOS verification frontier

- v1372 fresh scalar/RNG and full nine-pool/22-state comparisons pass. Complete
  video accepts all four demos, all 3996 updates and 38 compared regions each.
  Correcting the short lighting-mask row removes all remaining Demo 1 graphics
  differences; the cold artifact changes only 17 DATA bytes. Previous carpet
  image, packed-box and point-number repairs stay verified. Complete old/new
  raw evidence and source/ABI controls stay
  available, with lossless gzip recovery before archived-stream replay:
  [paired evidence](reconstruction/product/TH04_REPLAY_DIFFERENTIAL.md).
- v1368 accepts22 raw global-state blocks across all15984 demo updates, with
  instruction witnesses and distinct-value/nonzero coverage. Complete24-byte
  Boss and22-byte Midboss,12-byte player motion, options and timers match.
  Boss combat/death/respawn are unexercised; callback addresses are excluded,
  never masked. Replay adds `--global-states` to the v1367 reader recipe;
  receipt `dos-demo-v1368-globals-comparison-final.json` retains all raw hashes.
- v1367 full raw pool reader accepts all15984 updates across four original/
  ordinary demos. Shots/enemies/sparks/bullets/custom_entities/circles/items/
  pointnums/gather pools cover24952 B per update, plus graze and post-reset
  input/Shift. No byte normalization. Complete DGROUP streams and ordinary
  controls are pinned in `dos-demo-v1367-dgroup-comparison-final.json`; executed
  producer v2/v3 differs from the current independent reader. Rendering and
  input reset precede this seam; score update follows it. Reuse the streams to
  recover remaining global state owners; v1369 captures video separately.
- v1366 original/ordinary DOS naturally rotates all four demos through GAME.BAT.
  Each has 3996 updates plus terminal condition3996; all 15,988 boundaries match
  consumed input/raw shift, score/deltas, LCG/ring/cursor/helper counts/arguments
  and sampled player/resident state. New cold MAIN SHA-256 `16132526…`, MAP
  `2ee564c3…`; package `.analysis/build/th04-demo-angle-v1366/` retains old
  unchanged OP/MAINE/ZUN. Original MAIN load10FC/DGROUP3230; candidate
  load10FC/DGROUP34F7. Full readback retains v1365's failed comparison separately.
  The bounded cause is initialized midboss aim toggle1 versus old BSS0, reversing
  the stack pattern's fixed/aimed order. At stage-frame writes3282/3299/3315/3331,
  all 440*26 bullet bytes, toggle1/1/2/2, template angle and graze59 agree.
  Original/candidate pools are DGROUP5A22/4974. These four snapshots are scoped
  diagnostics, not a complete actor/effects trace. See
  [paired evidence and replay commands](reconstruction/product/TH04_REPLAY_DIFFERENTIAL.md).
- The user reports complete Normal routes/Endings/save and earlier invincible
  Easy/Lunatic runs. These are manual Windows observations.
- Recorded ordinary controls cover startup, OP options/Music Room/config
  persistence, Orange clear, Stage 2 entry, the repaired Kurumi empty-ring
  failure and Stage 3 entry. Seeded Good Endings reach registration and save
  the expected section; their final black frames do not accept fresh OP.
- Upper-left pellet corruption is confirmed and repaired by full EAX clearing;
  seven ordinary checkpoints exclude the old mark. The Stage 6 stripe's
  connection to initial scroll state remains inferred, with user confirmation
  that the stripe disappeared.
- Scalar/CPU/I-O controls reject planar and bullet drawing regressions. A
  440-bullet Lunatic/Turbo fixture measures improvement, including the extreme
  all-cloud phase. It is not a natural full Lunatic route or Windows FPS test.
- Full natural dense Lunatic timing/audio, the optional Windows 36,000-cycle
  profile and a second PC-98 emulator remain validation TODOs. New DOS
  performance work is outside the current native batch.

See [reusable hardware contracts and limits](PC98_HARDWARE_REUSE.md) for each
repair, replay entrypoint and evidence/knowledge routing.

## Retained ordinary native routes

Earlier GNU Reimu A Normal/Lunatic/Extra clear/save/restart and bounded dense
slowdown receipts retain their v1356 compiled producer and separate readers.
These are scoped Linux/private-Xvfb runs; they do not accept full original
DOS parity, uninstrumented FPS, Windows or every inner Ending phase. The prior
UBSan Normal clear claim remains revoked because mask0x19 is a sentinel.
Require mask<4 plus the selected shot bit. The failed v1360 route and initial
late Bomb probe remain failed, with their bounded valid observations preserved.
See [port status](PORTING_STATUS.md), the differential note, and native
`docs/port64/evidence/host-window.md` for exact receipts and coverage.

## Comparison priority for the next agent

The user's primary comparison is **original Japanese DOS versus reconstructed
DOS**, both through the PC-98 game route. Native x64 must also preserve gameplay
state and effects. Native-host equality and successful native clears do not
replace either comparison. Start with the four bundled demos, then bounded
recorded ordinary play; compare score, consumed input, RNG and actor state at
the same logical boundary, followed by VRAM/palette/effects and process/save
transitions. See [DOS/native differential handoff](reconstruction/product/TH04_REPLAY_DIFFERENTIAL.md).

TH08 is a read-only workflow reference, not TH04 evidence. Its active worktree
is dirty; do not edit it, run its builds, change its database or launch its game.
Complete trace/end/input-consumption guards and first-divergence diagnostics
are the useful parts to adapt. Complete DOS demo captures pass their configured state/video scopes. Native
selected state/RNG/counts and nine full actor pools now also agree across all
four demos. Whole native presentation and broader process/gameplay pairing
remain open.

## Windows DOS demo package

The demo directory retains `start-th04-normal.bat` (ordinary damage) and
`start-th04.bat` (separately compiled invincible MAIN), plus their two unchanged
images/products, standard 24,000-cycle profiles, emulator/font and English
source builder. Independent saves are preserved by full-image hash readback.
Native previews and optional launchers are archived outside that directory.
Windows `Build-TH04.ps1 -CheckOnly -Normal` passes; no rebuild or game launch
was performed. See [retention](ANALYSIS_RETENTION.md) for recovery.
