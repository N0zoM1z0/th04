# TH04 current handoff

The user is actively using the Windows host. Do not launch Windows GUI
tests, activate foreground windows or inject host keys. Keep every launch
muted; use headless checks or private Linux Xvfb instead. Actual Windows
window/input acceptance stays open under this constraint.

v1387 (native `5773c18`) calibrates native's shared refresh cadence to 17,723,227 ns. All
15,984 original VP4 GDC/time records independently reproduce the archived
PC98 timing calculation: 106 character clocks × 440 lines at 21.0526 MHz / 8.
Nearest-nanosecond error is 0.415160 ns per refresh; the old period drifted by
7,269.415160 ns. This is pinned emulator-mode evidence, not physical-board or
cross-emulator timing acceptance. Original MAIN0AAF:00B7/0975, load10FC and
DGROUP3230, target/reset/emulator/profile/CRC/EOF identities remain attested.

Only host_window.hpp and verify_host_window.py change among the 509 inputs
(manifest03351541…). Fresh whole cold GNU yields71 programs/69 passing CTests;
optimized UBSan/bounds cold-builds game/trace/shake. Actual muted SDL-dummy
OP→four demos→OP yields127 entire identical variant files, also identical to
the frozen a47f0496 parent. All15,988 selected original scalar/RNG/caller
boundaries agree. All40 complete index/TRAM/RGB samples and prior trace/save
hashes are unchanged from that parent. Prior full-nine-pool proofs retain
their original producer identities.

Independent actual Schedule controls pass20,000 original-mode boundaries and
reject the old period at boundary305. Separate actual FrontEnd controls pass
logical admission17 and host boundaries through1,000,000 refreshes, against
the unchanged GDC counter. Repaint/double-admission/backwards controls pass;
all127 ordinary capture hashes stay unchanged. Actual muted private Linux
Xvfb startup/Marisa B/input/focus/release/exit passes calibrated deadlines and
opens no audio device. Windows foreground/input remains untested.

Forty full original FONT/register frames are freshly regenerated with the
unchanged independent emitter. Raw RGB remains12/40 zeros; explicit DAC
diagnostics32/40 and eight blink-phase cases. Native-phase40/40 is diagnostic.
Original boot/process epoch, complete raw pictures and physical scanout remain
open. Next recover the common reset/boot/process elapsed timeline independently,
then broaden paired Boss/death/process routes; never fit per-Demo phase offsets.
The full goal stays active. Candidate-local-attested provenance and deferred
historical carpet/checkerboard exactness remain separate.

Recipes: DOS-root .analysis/reconstruction/probes/native-cadence-v1387/;
native receipts .analysis/port64/native-cadence-v1387/. Initial archive-iterator
guard failure is retained separately; corrected timing reader v2 passes.
Older a47f0496 and FONT/raster proofs keep their original scopes.

All jobs are terminal. Main441/live Ghidra and native345/target CI pass;
unavailable private native gates skip. Lossless retirement passes for
2,577 complete files and 1,044 source-backed caches, with
28,262 protected hashes and509 current source pins. Net 347.6 MiB
is reclaimed after the 28.4 MiB archive, before journal cost. The game,
trace/shake programs, independent probes, frozen sources and original reference
streams remain live. Unused CTest helper programs, objects/libraries and duplicate
capture/reference outputs are recoverable. Restore before CTest/reader replay:

```sh
python3 .analysis/reconstruction/probes/native-cadence-v1387/verify_retention.py --restore
```

Without --restore it checks complete recovery temporarily. Use one-shot probe
recipes in fresh output namespaces; keep earlier terminal proof files unchanged.

Earlier native shake, background-ring, laser, pellet, item-splash and MPN
palette repairs retain their frozen producer/proof identities. The
[focused differential note](reconstruction/product/TH04_REPLAY_DIFFERENTIAL.md)
indexes their results and archive recovery; they cannot attest the current
source without a fresh scoped replay.

Updated 2026-10-11. Current focus: complete DOS actor/presentation/process
comparison, followed by separate x64 state/effect fidelity. DOS demo state is
retained. This handoff indexes verified state; detailed experiments belong in focused notes and CSV
ledgers. The next behavioral validation focus is original DOS versus reconstructed
DOS, with native x64 fidelity checked separately. Reopen semantic work for a
reproduced differential or a concrete portable owner, not a general rename pass.

## Products and claim boundaries

| Product | State | Authority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Historical reconstruction | OP 93/93, MAIN 493/495, MAINE 72/72, ZUN 3/3 accepted authored functions | [Generated progress](PROGRESS.md), acceptance ledgers |
| Standalone DOS PC-98 game | Four products build from maintained local source without master.lib or ReC98 product includes; repaired normal and invincible variants | [DOS operation](DOS_BUILD.md), [hardware findings](PC98_HARDWARE_REUSE.md) |
| Semantic DOS source | Asset, memory, input/timing, scroll, bullet/VM/shot/item, RNG, score and process contracts clarified | [Semantic summary](SEMANTIC_READABILITY.md) |
| Linux/Windows x64 | Separate `port/modern-64` branch; scoped GNU Reimu A Normal/Lunatic/Extra clear/save/restart routes plus component Oracles; full fidelity still open | [Port status and TODO](PORTING_STATUS.md) |

Function acceptance is not whole-file exactness. OP/MAINE/ZUN counts cover
recovered payload functions, not original packed-file extents. MAIN's carpet
and checkerboard cases remain deferred; no acceptance is promoted by the
native fixes or this runtime batch. Targets remain
`candidate-local-attested` (a provenance gap).

## DOS verification frontier

- v1372 fresh scalar/RNG and full nine-pool/22-state comparisons pass. Complete
  video accepts all four demos, all 3996 updates and 38 compared regions each.
  Correcting the short lighting-mask row removes all remaining Demo 1 graphics
  differences; the cold artifact changes only 17 DATA bytes. Previous carpet
  image, packed-box and point-number repairs stay verified. Complete old/new
  raw evidence and source/ABI controls stay
  available, with lossless gzip recovery before archived-stream replay:
  [paired evidence](reconstruction/product/TH04_REPLAY_DIFFERENTIAL.md).
- v1368 accepts22 raw global-state blocks across all15984 demo updates, with
  instruction witnesses and distinct-value/nonzero coverage. Complete24-byte
  Boss and22-byte Midboss,12-byte player motion, options and timers match.
  Boss combat/death/respawn are unexercised; callback addresses are excluded,
  never masked. Replay adds `--global-states` to the v1367 reader recipe;
  receipt `dos-demo-v1368-globals-comparison-final.json` retains all raw hashes.
- v1367 full raw pool reader accepts all15984 updates across four original/
  ordinary demos. Shots/enemies/sparks/bullets/custom_entities/circles/items/
  pointnums/gather pools cover24952 B per update, plus graze and post-reset
  input/Shift. No byte normalization. Complete DGROUP streams and ordinary
  controls are pinned in `dos-demo-v1367-dgroup-comparison-final.json`; executed
  producer v2/v3 differs from the current independent reader. Rendering and
  input reset precede this seam; score update follows it. Reuse the streams to
  recover remaining global state owners; v1369 captures video separately.
- v1366 original/ordinary DOS naturally rotates all four demos through GAME.BAT.
  Each has 3996 updates plus terminal condition3996; all 15,988 boundaries match
  consumed input/raw shift, score/deltas, LCG/ring/cursor/helper counts/arguments
  and sampled player/resident state. New cold MAIN SHA-256 `16132526…`, MAP
  `2ee564c3…`; package `.analysis/build/th04-demo-angle-v1366/` retains old
  unchanged OP/MAINE/ZUN. Original MAIN load10FC/DGROUP3230; candidate
  load10FC/DGROUP34F7. Full readback retains v1365's failed comparison separately.
  The bounded cause is initialized midboss aim toggle1 versus old BSS0, reversing
  the stack pattern's fixed/aimed order. At stage-frame writes3282/3299/3315/3331,
  all 440*26 bullet bytes, toggle1/1/2/2, template angle and graze59 agree.
  Original/candidate pools are DGROUP5A22/4974. These four snapshots are scoped
  diagnostics, not a complete actor/effects trace. See
  [paired evidence and replay commands](reconstruction/product/TH04_REPLAY_DIFFERENTIAL.md).
- The user reports complete Normal routes/Endings/save and earlier invincible
  Easy/Lunatic runs. These are manual Windows observations.
- Recorded ordinary controls cover startup, OP options/Music Room/config
  persistence, Orange clear, Stage 2 entry, the repaired Kurumi empty-ring
  failure and Stage 3 entry. Seeded Good Endings reach registration and save
  the expected section; their final black frames do not accept fresh OP.
- Upper-left pellet corruption is confirmed and repaired by full EAX clearing;
  seven ordinary checkpoints exclude the old mark. The Stage 6 stripe's
  connection to initial scroll state remains inferred, with user confirmation
  that the stripe disappeared.
- Scalar/CPU/I-O controls reject planar and bullet drawing regressions. A
  440-bullet Lunatic/Turbo fixture measures improvement, including the extreme
  all-cloud phase. It is not a natural full Lunatic route or Windows FPS test.
- Full natural dense Lunatic timing/audio, the optional Windows 36,000-cycle
  profile and a second PC-98 emulator remain validation TODOs. New DOS
  performance work is outside the current native batch.

See [reusable hardware contracts and limits](PC98_HARDWARE_REUSE.md) for each
repair, replay entrypoint and evidence/knowledge routing.

## Retained ordinary native routes

Earlier GNU Reimu A Normal/Lunatic/Extra clear/save/restart and bounded dense
slowdown receipts retain their v1356 compiled producer and separate readers.
These are scoped Linux/private-Xvfb runs; they do not accept full original
DOS parity, uninstrumented FPS, Windows or every inner Ending phase. The prior
UBSan Normal clear claim remains revoked because mask0x19 is a sentinel.
Require mask<4 plus the selected shot bit. The failed v1360 route and initial
late Bomb probe remain failed, with their bounded valid observations preserved.
See [port status](PORTING_STATUS.md), the differential note, and native
`docs/port64/evidence/host-window.md` for exact receipts and coverage.

## Comparison priority for the next agent

The user's primary comparison is **original Japanese DOS versus reconstructed
DOS**, both through the PC-98 game route. Native x64 must also preserve gameplay
state and effects. Native-host equality and successful native clears do not
replace either comparison. Start with the four bundled demos, then bounded
recorded ordinary play; compare score, consumed input, RNG and actor state at
the same logical boundary, followed by VRAM/palette/effects and process/save
transitions. See [DOS/native differential handoff](reconstruction/product/TH04_REPLAY_DIFFERENTIAL.md).

TH08 is a read-only workflow reference, not TH04 evidence. Its active worktree
is dirty; do not edit it, run its builds, change its database or launch its game.
Complete trace/end/input-consumption guards and first-divergence diagnostics
are the useful parts to adapt. Complete DOS demo captures pass their configured state/video scopes. Native
selected state/RNG/counts and nine full actor pools now also agree across all
four demos. Whole native presentation and broader process/gameplay pairing
remain open.

## Windows DOS demo package

The demo directory retains `start-th04-normal.bat` (ordinary damage) and
`start-th04.bat` (separately compiled invincible MAIN), plus their two unchanged
images/products, standard 24,000-cycle profiles, emulator/font and English
source builder. Independent saves are preserved by full-image hash readback.
Native previews and optional launchers are archived outside that directory.
Windows `Build-TH04.ps1 -CheckOnly -Normal` passes; no rebuild or game launch
was performed. See [retention](ANALYSIS_RETENTION.md) for recovery.
